package com.bydmate.app.data.charging

/**
 * Tracks `gunConnectState` across polls and reports the connected→disconnected
 * edge — the moment a charging session ends and we should finalize a row.
 *
 * Why a separate class? The pre-2.5.11 live-edge detector lived inside
 * TrackingService and consumed `data.chargeGunState` from DiPlus. On Leopard 3
 * DiPlus often runs in reduced-payload mode and omits `ChargeGun` entirely,
 * so the DiPlus-driven edge never fired and one real charging session was
 * dropped (no end-of-charging row written). Sourcing the gun state from
 * autoservice (system SDK) instead makes this independent of DiPlus, but
 * the bookkeeping was easier to reason about — and easier to unit-test —
 * once extracted from the polling loop.
 *
 * Encoding (autoservice fid 876609586, dev=1009):
 *   1 = NONE        (no gun)
 *   2 = AC
 *   3 = DC
 *   4 = AC_DC
 *   5 = VTOL
 *
 * Edge rule: previous state was a known non-NONE value AND current is NONE.
 * A null reading is a transient autoservice glitch; we keep the previous
 * value and refuse to fire — phantom edges from sentinel reads were the
 * exact failure mode this class was written to prevent.
